    ## Setting Up a Custom Domain (Optional)
    
    You can use your own custom domain (like "eribyte.net") instead of the default "yourusername.github.io" address.
    
    ### Purchase a Domain
    
    1. Purchase a domain from a provider like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com) 
    2. After purchase, you'll need to access the DNS settings for your domain
    
    ### Configure Your Domain
    
    1. In your GitHub repository, go to Settings → GitHub Pages
    2. Under "Custom domain", enter your domain name (e.g., "yourname.com")
    3. Click "Save"
    4. Check "Enforce HTTPS" once it becomes available
    
    ### Update DNS Settings at Your Domain Provider
    
    For Namecheap:
    1. Log in to your Namecheap account
    2. Go to "Domain List" and click "Manage" next to your domain
    3. Click on "Advanced DNS" tab
    4. Add these "A Records":
       - Host: @, Value: 185.199.108.153, TTL: Automatic
       - Host: @, Value: 185.199.109.153, TTL: Automatic
       - Host: @, Value: 185.199.110.153, TTL: Automatic
       - Host: @, Value: 185.199.111.153, TTL: Automatic

       4a. sometimes these ip's may change. if your website stops working look at [github's official guild](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) to see the new ones
    5. Add a "CNAME Record":
       - Host: www, Value: yourusername.github.io, TTL: Automatic (EX: Host: www, Value: eribytevt.github.io, TTL: Automatic)
        
    For detailed instructions with other providers, see [GitHub's official guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).
    
    ## Customizing Your Website
    
    You can further customize your website by editing the files directly:
    
    ### Basic Customization
    
    1. Log in to GitHub and navigate to your repository
    2. Click on the file you want to edit (e.g., index.html)
    3. Click the pencil icon to edit the file
    4. Make your changes
    5. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"
    
    ### What You Can Change:
    
    - **Colors**: In index.css, look for color codes (like #414141) and change them
    - **Text**: In index.html, you can edit any text between tags
    - **Layout**: For more advanced changes, you can modify the structure in both HTML and CSS files
    
    ## Troubleshooting
    
    ### Website Not Appearing
    - It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to appear (Longer if you use a custom domain due to DNS propagation)
    - Make sure your repository is public
    - Check that your files are in the main branch, not in any folders
    
    ### Custom Domain Not Working
    - DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate
    - Verify your DNS settings match exactly with the recommendations
    - Make sure you saved the custom domain in your GitHub Pages settings
